<h2>About ConceptNet</h2>
<p>
ConceptNet is a semantic network containing lots of things computers should
know about the world, especially when understanding text written by people.
</p>
<p>
It is built from nodes representing <i>concepts</i>, in the form of words or
short phrases of natural language, and labeled relationships between them.
These are the kinds of things computers need to know to search for information
better, answer questions, and understand people's goals.
If you wanted to build your own Watson, this should be a good place
to start!
</p>

<p>Notice how the relations between concepts can be abstract notions
such as MadeOf, which we use to mean the same thing across all languages; or
they can be language-specific text such as "inversely proportional to".

<p>You can click any of these links to begin browsing ConceptNet. You can
discover other concepts we know about by changing the URL (we're working on a
search interface).</p>
<h2>ConceptNet 5 is free</h2>
<p>ConceptNet 5 comes largely from the hard work of hundreds of thousands of
people who gave their time and knowledge for free. So ConceptNet is free as
well, released under a choice of two Creative Commons licenses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can get the entirety of ConceptNet 5 under the
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">
    Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
  </a> license.
  </li>
  <li>You may also use a smaller version, called the "ConceptNet 5 Core",
  under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">
    Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
  </a> license. This version is free for any purpose as long as you give
  credit to the <a href="#contact">Digital Intuition</a> team. However, this
  version is necessarily missing a large number of statements learned from
  Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and DBPedia, all of which are Attribution-ShareAlike
  resources.
</ul>
<p>
  (Until we have a separate download, you get ConceptNet 5 Core by using
  ConceptNet 5 and discarding all nodes with <code>{license: 'CC-By-SA'}</code>
  in them.)
</p>
</ul>
<h2 id="truthgoggles">In the news: Truth Goggles</h2>
<p>
"Truth Goggles" is a project in development by Dan Schultz that scans through
political articles and finds relevant, related facts on Politifact. This
research is partially based on ConceptNet, and it's been getting attention in
<a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3574">blogs</a> and <a
href="http://www.npr.org/2011/11/27/142821487/truth-goggles-double-checks-what-politicians-say">in the news</a>.
</p>

<p> The tool that Truth Goggles uses for doing document understanding with
ConceptNet is called Luminoso, and it has recently been spun out into a company
by that name.  Visit <a href="http://lumino.so">lumino.so</a> for more
information about this process and the company.</p>

<h2>Sources and how to contribute</h2>
<p>
Previous versions of ConceptNet were a home-grown crowd-sourced project, where
we ran a Web site collecting facts from people who came to the site. The Web of
Data is much bigger than that now. Our data comes from many different sources,
many of which you can contribute to and improve not just the state of
computational knowledge, but of <i>human</i> knowledge.
</p>
<ul>
<li>To begin with, ConceptNet 5 contains almost all the data from <a
href="http://csc.media.mit.edu/docs/conceptnet">ConceptNet 4</a>, created by
contributors to the Open Mind Common Sense project.</li>
<li>Much of our knowledge comes from the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org">English Wikipedia</a> and its contributors, through two
sources:</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBPedia</a> extracts knowledge from the
infoboxes that appear on articles.</li>
<li><a href="http://reverb.cs.washington.edu">ReVerb</a> is a machine reading
project, extracting relational knowledge from the actual text of each article.
</li>
</ul>
<li>We have also parsed a large amount of content from the <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org">English Wiktionary</a>, including synonyms,
antonyms, translations of concepts into hundreds of languages, and multiple
labeled word senses for many English words.</li>
<li>More dictionary-style knowledge comes from <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu">WordNet</a>.</li>
<li>Some knowledge about people's intuitive word associations comes from "games
with a purpose". We learn things in English from the <a
href="http://www.gwap.com">GWAP project</a>'s word game
<a href="http://www.gwap.com/gwap/gamesPreview/verbosity">Verbosity</a>,
and in Japanese from <a href="http://nadya.jp">nadya.jp</a>.
</ul>
<h2>ConceptNet 5 is a graph</h2>
<p>To be precise, it's a <i>hypergraph</i>, meaning it has edges about edges.
Each statement in ConceptNet has <i>justfications</i> pointing to it,
explaining where it comes from and how reliable the information seems to be.
</p>
<p>
Previous versions of ConceptNet has been distributed as idiosyncratic database
structures plus some software to interact with them. ConceptNet 5 is not a
piece of software or a database; it is a graph. It's a set of nodes and edges,
which we can represent in multiple formats including <a
href="#download">JSON</a>. You probably know better than
we do what software you want to use to interact with it!
</p>
<p>Some other interesting properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ConceptNet graph is <i>ID-less</i>. Every node and edge contains all
the information necessary to identify it and no more in its URI, and does not
rely on
arbitrarily-assigned IDs. The advantage of this is that if multiple branches of
ConceptNet are developed in multiple places, we can later merge them simply by
taking the union of the nodes and edges. (And we <a href="#development">hope
for this to happen!</a>)</li>
<li>ConceptNet is a <i>property graph</i>, meaning that some of its information
is stored in its nodes and edges. For example, each concept stores its
human-readable name, and its language. This representation is not quite the
same as RDF, but it does match up with other standards such as GraphML and Blueprints (which we are working on interoperating with).
</li>
<li>ConceptNet contains concepts and relations that are pointers to the greater
Semantic Web, via <a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBPedia</a> and soon via RDF/OWL WordNet. For example, our concept 
<a href="http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/web/concept/en/cat">cat</a> is linked
to the DBPedia node at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat</a>.
</ul>
<h2>Beta release</h2>
<p>This page provides you with a beta release of ConceptNet 5.0. The actual
release will have the same graph structure, but slightly different contents.</p>
<p>Building ConceptNet 5 is a time-consuming process. Basically, there's
another version in the pipeline right now, but it still has to take some
time to index all the statements.</p>
<h3>Known bugs in this release</h3>
<li>Much of the Wiktionary data is missing; it generally only contains the
first sense for each word.</li>
<li>WordNet senses can be found through the Web API, but are missing from this
data..</li>
<h2>Web API</h2>
<p>The data in ConceptNet 5 is accessible through a Web API that returns JSON
data. Here's some very short documentation for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every concept and assertion in ConceptNet has a URI. Put
<code>http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/data</code> before that URI to retrieve
information about that concept, including its incoming and outgoing edges.
If there are lots of edges, the results may include a "next" URL to get more.
</li>
<li>Another way to say this is that if you browse to the Web page for any
concept, change <code>/web</code> to <code>/data</code> to look it up in the
API.</li>
</ul>
<p>More detailed documentation is being developed on our
<a href="http://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki">wiki</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="download">Downloading ConceptNet 5</h2>
<p>If you want all the data in ConceptNet for your application, you can have
it! Here it is as some <a href="downloads/">extremely
compressed JSON files</a>. Be warned, this ~1.1 gigabyte download will
uncompress to nearly 24 gigabytes of data.</p>
<p>
If you want to look things up quickly in ConceptNet 5, you may want to use the
MongoDB 2.0 database that we have built. That database, with all its indexes,
is at 111 gigabytes and counting. (Informative URIs have their price.) The best
way to do this would be to mount our drive through through Amazon's <abbr
title="Enterprise Block Storage">EBS</abbr>. <a href="#contact">Contact us</a>
if you want to do that really soon; we're also working on becoming one of their
public datasets.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>ConceptNet 5 is an open-source project, developed with GPLv3 code hosted on
<a href="http://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>ConceptNet is part of the Commonsense Computing Initiative, a collaboration
between the MIT Media Lab and other labs and companies around the world. If you
want to set up a sister project to collect a specific kind of data -- perhaps
focusing on a particular domain or improving our coverage of a particular
language -- we'd be happy for you to <a href="#contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2>Authors</h2>
<p>The development of ConceptNet 5 is led by <a
href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~rspeer">Rob Speer</a>, advised by
<a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~havasi">Catherine Havasi</a>.
It is also developed by Julian Chaidez, Justin Venezuela, and Yen-Ling Kuo.</p>
